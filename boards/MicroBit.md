The BBC micro:bit is a small microcontroller board designed for computer education in the UK - see the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit) for more information.

There are multiple versions of the micro:bit available:

* micro:bit v2 - full-featured support with 2v08 and later (these are the ones with a speaker)
* micro:bit v1.5 - (cut-down Espruino, limited memory) to use the sensors you'll need 2v07 or later
* micro:bit v1 - (cut-down Espruino, limited memory) supported from Espruino 1v95

We are currently *not* using universal hex files, so you will need to load the
correct hex file (`_microbit1` or `_microbit2`) for your board.

micro:bit contains:

* USB communications and JST power connectors
* A 5x5 array of LEDs for use as a display
* Two user-configurable buttons, and one reset button
* An accelerometer and magnetometer (LSM303AGR, or MAG3110 + MMA8652 on older boards)
* Speaker & Microphone on v2
* A Nordic nRF52833 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller (512kB flash, 128kB RAM) on v2, or nRF51822 ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller (256kB flash, 16kB RAM) on v1.
* A Freescale Kinetis chip to handle USB - this provides a virtual USB flash drive that allows firmware updates just by saving a file.

micro:bit v1
------------

While we do provide Espruino for the micro:bit v1, it takes a lot of memory to provide Bluetooth functionality and as a result some functionality has had to be removed compared to the v2 and other Espruino devices:

* No ES6 Features (ArrayBuffer map/forEach, template literals, arrow functions, etc)
* No debug or code autocomplete
* No advanced library functions (In [the reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference),
any function with the comment "Note: This is only available in some devices: not
devices with low flash memory" will not be included)
* Low program memory (Espruino on micro:bit has only 350 vars available, whereas
on other devices it has over 10 times that)

If you want the full experience, please consider buying [an official Espruino Board](http://www.espruino.com/Order).

Flashing Espruino
------------------

<a name="firmware-updates"></a>There is a build of Espruino designed specifically for the micro:bit. Releases are available from the [Download page](/Download) for [micro:bit 1](/Download#microbit1) or [micro:bit 2](/Download#microbit2) - however you may also download 'cutting edge' builds [from here](http://www.espruino.com/binaries/travis/master/) - these are updated every time something changes in Espruino's source code, so may occasionally not work.

To flash onto your micro:bit:

* Plug it into USB. A drive called `MICROBIT` should appear
* [Download](/Download) the microbit `.hex` file for Espruino (ensuring that you have the `microbit1` or `microbit2` file depending on your device), and save it directly into the root of that drive
* The yellow LED on the micro:bit will blink quickly for a few seconds, and will then stop.
* The Espruino firmware is now installed!


Using the micro:bit
-------------------

There are two ways to communicate with your micro:bit:

### USB

This is the easiest, and recommended way of communicating with Espruino.

For Windows users, you will [need to install drivers first](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration) - on other platforms, the board should 'just work'.

Follow the [instructions in the Quick Start tutorial](/Quick+Start) to install the Web IDE (ignore the `Plugging in` section), and you should be able to communicate with the micro:bit just like any other board.

**Note:** as the micro:bit has a display but no general-purpose LEDs, the tutorials in the Quick Start that use `LED1`/etc will not work without modification.

### Bluetooth Low Energy (BT 4.0 / Bluetooth Smart)

You can also program the micro:bit wirelessly!

If you have a device that supports [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/), you can go directly to the [Online Web IDE](https://espruino.com/ide) in your web browser, and can connect with that.

* Click the connect icon at the top left
* Choose `Web Bluetooth` - if this doesn't exist, it's because your device doesn't have Web Bluetooth enabled. Click the `status` link for more information.
* Now you should be prompted for a device to connect to by the web browser
* Click it, and wait - connection can take around 10 seconds
* Finally the icon up the top left should change state to 'Connected', and you'll be able to program Espruino as normal - but via Bluetooth!

micro:bit Functionality
-----------------------

The micro:bit has a few variables and functions that are useful:

## `BTN1` and `BTN2`

These read the state of the two buttons, for example:

`BTN1.read()` or `digitalRead(BTN1)` return 1 or 0 depending on the state of the button

The following will write `Pressed` each time the button is pressed:

```
setWatch(function() {
  console.log("Pressed");
}, BTN1, {repeat:true, debounce:20, edge:"falling"});
```

Or this will write `Pressed` or `Released`:

```
setWatch(function(e) {
  if (e.state) console.log("Released");
  else console.log("Pressed");
}, BTN1, {repeat:true, debounce:20, edge:"both"});
```

**Note:** Currently the state of the buttons is *inverted* - `1` means not pressed, `0` means pressed.

## `show(bitmap)`

Shows graphics on the built-in 5x5 LED screen. This takes a binary number or a string. For example:

* `show(0)` shows nothing
* `show(1)` lights the first LED
* `show(0b1000)` lights the fourth LED
* `show(0b1111111111111111111111111)` or `show(0x1FFFFFF)` lights all LEDs
* The following will draw a smiley face:

```
show("1   1\n"+
     "  1  \n"+
     "  1  \n"+
     "1   1\n"+
     " 111 \n");
````

You can use the Graphics library to display text and images, for example the following with scroll 'Espruino' across the display:

```
g = Graphics.createArrayBuffer(5,5,1,{msb:false});
g.flip = function(){show(this.buffer);};

var x = 0;
setInterval(function() {
  x++;
  if (x>50)x=0;
  g.clear();
  g.drawString("Espruino",5-x);
  g.flip();
}, 100);
```

## `Microbit` class

This contains functions for interfacing with the Micro:bit hardware. See [a full reference here](http://www.espruino.com/Reference#Microbit)

**Note:** In `2v07` and earlier the `Microbit` class doesn't exist and instead there are just `acceleration()` and `compass()` functions.

### `Microbit.accel()`

This returns an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` elements, each containing the force in that axis in `g`.

**Note:** In `2v07` and earlier this doesn't exist and `acceleration()` is available instead.

You can also use `Microbit.accelOn()` which then creates an event whenever data is available, which can be read with `Microbit.on('accel', function(d) { ... })`

### `Microbit.mag()`

This returns an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` elements, indicating the current direction of the magnetic field

**Note:** In `2v07` and earlier this doesn't exist and `compass()` is available instead.

### `Microbit.play(waveform, samplesPerSecond, callback)`

**Micro:bit version 2 only:** plays a sound - [see the reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference#l_Microbit_play) for more information

### `Microbit.record(samplesPerSecond, callback, samples)`

**Micro:bit version 2 only:** records a sound - see the reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference#l_Microbit_record) for more information
